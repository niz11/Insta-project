How we created a second view controller-
    1) add a new viewcontroller to Main.storyboard. simply like adding a label or a text field.
    2) add a new file to project. A coca touch class of the kind - UIViewController
    3) press on the new view controller in main.story board and go to the third menu in the right
    4) under costum class -> add the new coca file you just created to reached to the viewcontroller. a swift file of cousr
    4) create a button, ctrl  + click it and drug the blue error to the other view controller. And that's how we connect them.
